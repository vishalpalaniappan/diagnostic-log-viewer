# Diagnostic Log Viewer

The Diagnostic Log Viewer is a tool which can be used to view and interact with Compressed Diagnostic Log (CDL) files. See background for more information on CDL files. The viewer can be used to step through the execution sequence of a program while investigating the call stack, variables and exceptions for each position in the program as it led to failure.

# Demo 

A demo of the viewer is available here.
    -   The demo loads a CDL file generated by running compress.py in the yscope-previews repo.
    -   The compress.py program was injected with diagnostic logs using the Automated Diagnostic Log Injector (ADLI) tool and run to generate the CDL file. The ADLI tool will be released soon.


# Background

> [!NOTE]  
> A more detailed introduction to diagnostic logging and the diagnostic tools it enables is in development.

CDL files are generated through a process called Diagnostic Logging (DL) in which the logtype, variable values and exceptions for each instruction are logged. Since DL logging automates the diagnosis of software failures, the ideal version of any diagnostic tool built with CDL files will inherently be a fully automated tool. 

Diagnostic logging is practically enabled by Automated Diagnostic Log Injector(ADLI) tools which automatically insert the necessary log statements to extract the diagnostic information. The ADLI tool appends a simplified syntax tree for the source code in the header of the CDL file and provides logtype ID map which is used when inserting the log statements, effectively compressing the logtypes at the source while logging. 

Since diagnostic logging provides an uninterrputed trace of the logic as it led to failure and it automatically diagnosis the failure, it will be possible to build fully automated root cause analysis techniques.
